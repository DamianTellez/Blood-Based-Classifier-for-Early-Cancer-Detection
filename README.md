# Blood-Based-Classifier-for-Early-Cancer-Detection
 Samsung Project: This project focuses on reducing the number of biomarkers required to detect early‑stage cancer tumors. Lowering the dimensionality of the dataset leads to faster model training and reduced computational demands, making the overall solution more efficient and cost‑effective.
