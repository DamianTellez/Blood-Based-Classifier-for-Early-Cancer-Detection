# Blood-Based-Classifier-for-Early-Cancer-Detection

This project focuses on reducing the number of biomarkers required to detect early‑stage cancer tumors. Lowering the dimensionality of the dataset leads to faster model training and reduced computational demands, making the overall solution more efficient and cost‑effective.

Overview: 

- The feature set was reduced from 43 to just 8 parameters—an 81.4% dimensionality reduction.
- Develop a completely functional model to detect a possible early cancer.   
- The final model achieved an overall accuracy of 0.9725.
